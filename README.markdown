@tech_iitb is a google calender interface.Every time a person pings it, it returns the current day events as seen in the calender. 
This app was developed for use of freshers at IITB who do not have access to net and for people who wish to know of events but dont have access to internet.

Usage:
Rename the config_techiitb.template to config_techiitb.php. Add a Google API key (you can get it from API Console) and TxtWeb app key.

[@techathon](http://developer.txtweb.com/user/apps/techathon)
----------

@techathon is a basic quiz app for conducting fun quizzes. 
At the start of every year we have a tech quiz aimed at getting people involved with technical activities. There are 3 questions put up via poster and people respond via SMS to some number. This time around I made this app for better management of the system. Responses are logged to file which can be viewed online. Comparison becomes easy and has lower hassels.

Usage:
Rename config_techathon.template to config_techathon.php. Add the TxtWeb app key in this file.
